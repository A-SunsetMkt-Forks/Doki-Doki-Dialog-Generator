When an object is selected, the [toolbox](toolbox.md) shows you options for the selected object.

If a character is selected, the [character panel](panels/characters.md) is shown. If a sprite is selected, the [sprite panel](panels/sprite.md) is shown.

## Click through

Sometimes, the object you want to select is hidden behind another one. In this case, you can use the click through behavior. If you click on an object that is already selected, the click goes through the selected object and selects whatever is behind it.
