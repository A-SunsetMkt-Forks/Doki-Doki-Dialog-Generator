# Backgrounds

Like with the online version, the upload button in the [Backgrounds Panel](../panels/backgrounds.md) can be used to
_temporarily_ add new backgrounds. In order to permanently add new backgrounds, the desktop version has the
`custom_backgrounds` folder.

## Directly add to folder

By choosing "DDDG" -> "Open background folder in file manager" in the menu, you can directly add new images to the
folder. These new images will be available once the tool had been restarted.

## Installing backgrounds

Backgrounds that have been uploaded in the [Backgrounds Panel](../panels/backgrounds.md) can be installed from there.
In the settings of an uploaded background you can click 'Install'. The background is now added to the
`custom_backgrounds`

## Uninstalling backgrounds

Backgrounds in the `custom_backgrounds` folder can be uninstalled from inside the tool by selecting them in the
[Backgrounds Panel](../panels/backgrounds.md). In the settings of an installed background you can click 'Uninstall'.
The background is now deleted from the `custom_backgrounds` folder.
