# Custom characters

Like with the online version, you can temporarily add new content packs in the [Content Pack Panel](../panels/general/content_packs.md). These can add new characters or add new expressions and poses to existing characters. In order to permanently add content_packs, the desktop version has the `custom_characters` folder.

The `custom_characters` folder can be opened by selecting "DDDG" -> "Open background folder in file manager" in the menu.

## Installing content packs

Content packs that have been added using the [Content Pack Panel](../panels/general/content_packs.md) can be installed from
there. Select the a content pack and click 'Install'. The content pack is now added to the `custom_characters` folder
and will be loaded on every start-up.

## Uninstalling content packs

Content packs in the `custom_characters` folder can be uninstalled from inside the tool by selecting them in the
[Content Pack Panel](../panels/general/content_packs.md). After selecting an installed content pack you can click
'Uninstall'.

The content pack will now be deleted from the `custom_characters` folder.

NOTE: Due to the inner workings of the tool, the uninstall won't happen until the next startup. So don't be confused
if the pack is still in the `custom_characters` folder.

## Activating and deactivating content packs

Sometimes you want to keep content packs readily available, but don't need them all the time. For that, you can activate and deactivate content packs, without having to install and uninstall them constantly.

When a character pack is selected in the [Content Pack Panel](../panels/general/content_packs.md), you can click "Deactivate"
or "Activate" to toogle activation of the pack.

## Manually adding new characters

There are two ways to add new characters `custom_characters`:

- As a [Simple Characters](characters/simpleCharacters.md)
- Or, if your character needs multiple different poses, hair styles, eye colors, etc., you can learn the more complex
  [JSON Format](characters/json.md).
