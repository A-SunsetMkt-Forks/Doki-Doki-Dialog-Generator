# The custom download directory

The download folder is the folder that files get saved into if you press the "D" button in the
[toolbox](../toolbox.md). In the desktop version, this folder can be customized by selecting "DDDG" -> "Set download
folder" in the menu.

The currently set download folder is saved. Next time you open the application, the download folder you set will still
be set.

Using "DDDG" -> "Open download folder in file manager" in the menu, you can quickly open the current download folder.
