# Desktop

The desktop version of DDDG is essentially the same as the web version, but it comes with some helpful features, most of which are just difficult to realize with a browser. (Specifically file handling)

The desktop version is available for these platforms:

- [Windows 64-bit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OZQvd1fhPOjmodgb6hyxeaVosYu1lDHb)
- [Linux 64-bit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KMIvN4-HGiOiXYfk4gDnCXCsPZ3dMtHW)
- [Linux 64-bit ARM](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mYG6kvvHCl1BHfU-By3pm9cvWvbPnBD3)
- [Mac OS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k1MSkGjaHvNyMvsLvSjxAWsttj882YAe)

## Extra features

The desktop version can do everything the web version can, but has a few extra features:

- [Custom download folder](desktop/download_directory.md)
- [Custom Backgrounds](desktop/backgrounds.md)
- [Custom Characters](desktop/characters.md)
  - [Simple Characters](desktop/characters/simpleCharacters.md)
  - [JSON Format](desktop/characters/json.md)
