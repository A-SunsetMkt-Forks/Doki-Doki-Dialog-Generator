# The sprite panel

![The sprite panel](sprite.png 'The sprite panel')

This panel allows you manipulate sprites that have already been [added to scene](add.md). The panel is shown once a sprite is [selected](../selection.md).

## Position/Size

Note for all of these: The size of the image in total 1280 in width and 720 in height.

### X

The horizontal position of the sprite.

### Y

The vertical position of the sprite.

### Width

The horizontal size of the sprite.

### Height

The vertical size of the sprite.

### Lock ratio

When checked, every change in width or height will force the other size value to adjust so the ratio between the values stays constant. This prevents the sprite from becoming stretched or squashed.

## Layer

These buttons allow you to move the sprite ahead or behind other objects.

Note: Sprites that are in front of the textbox will always be in front of objects that are not, regardless of what you do with these buttons.

### &#10515;

Moves the sprite to be behind all other objects.

### &#8595;

### &#8593;

Moves the sprite to be ahead of the next higher object.

### &#10514;

### In front of textbox?

If checked the sprite will be shown in front of the textbox. Also including all objects behind the textbox.

## Opacity

A value from 0 (fully transparent) to 100 (fully opaque).
