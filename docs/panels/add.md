# The add character panel

![The add character panel](add.png 'The add character panel')

This panel allows you to add new characters and sprites to the scene.

## Characters

The stickers all represent characters. They are either directly from the game, or the most commonly used fan creations.

## Sprites

At the end of the character list, there are two buttons: "Custom sprite upload" and "Custom sprite from URL"

### Custom sprite upload

This opens a dialog where you can select a file from your computer to use as a sprite.

### Custom sprite from URL

This opens a dialog where you can enter the URL of a file hosted somewhere online to use as a sprite.

NOTE: This requires the "access-control-allow-origin" setting of the server to allow the generator to use them. Some hosting services might have a problem with that, but sites like imgur.com are working fine.
