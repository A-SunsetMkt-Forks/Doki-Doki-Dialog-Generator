# The Content Packs panel

![The Content Packs panel](content_packs.png 'The Content Packs panel')

This panel allows you to add and manage content packs.

### Add new Pack

This opens a prompt to enter the URL of a content pack.

### Desktop only features

In the desktop version, there are additional features to manage content packs. These can be accessed by clicking on the name of the content pack to select it.

#### Install

This persistently adds the content pack to the tool. If you restart it, the content pack will still be there.

#### Uninstall

This removes a previously installed content pack from the tool. If you restart it, the content pack will be gone.

#### Deactivate

If you click this, the Content Pack will remain installed, but will not be activated once the tool loads. This is helpful if you have many content packs that you often need, but don't need all of them at once.

#### Activate

Re-activates a content pack after deactivation.
